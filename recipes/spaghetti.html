    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>It is a staple food of traditional Italian cuisine. Like other pasta, spaghetti is made of milled wheat, water,
       and sometimes enriched with vitamins and minerals. Italian spaghetti is typically made from durum-wheat semolina.
       Usually the pasta is white because refined flour is used, but whole wheat flour may be added. Spaghettoni is a thicker
       form of spaghetti, while spaghettini is a thinner form. Capellini is a very thin spaghetti, while vermicelli refers
       to intermediate thicknesses. </p>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>½ pound Italian sausage</li>
        <li>1 (14.5 ounce) can diced tomatoes</li>
        <li>2 bay leaves</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon Italian seasoning</li>
        <li>½ teaspoon garlic powder</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon dried basil</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon dried oregano</li>
        <li>4 (6.5 ounce) cans tomato sauce</li>
        <li>salt and pepper to taste</li>

    <ol>
        <li>Cook and stir sausage in a large skillet over medium heat until browned. Drain.</li>

            basil, oregano, salt, pepper to Italian sausage in the skillet. Simmer sauce over
