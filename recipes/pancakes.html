    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>A pancake, also known as a hotcake, griddlecake, or flapjack, is a flat cake,
        often thin and round, prepared from a starch-based batter that may contain eggs,
        milk, and butter, and then cooked on a hot surface such as a griddle or frying pan.
        It is a type of batter bread. Archaeological evidence suggests that pancakes were
        probably eaten in prehistoric societies.</p>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>Flour</li>
        <li>Sugar</li>
        <li>Leaveners</li>
        <li>Salt</li>
        <li>Buttermilk</li>
        <li>Milk</li>
        <li>Eggs</li>
        <li>Butter</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Mix the dry ingredients: Combine flour, sugar, baking powder, baking soda, and salt in a large bowl.</li>
        <li>Mix the wet ingredients: Beat the buttermilk, milk, eggs, and melted butter together in a separate bowl.
            Do not combine the wet and dry ingredients until right before you cook the pancakes.</li>
        <li>Make the pancakes: Add the wet ingredients to the dry ingredients and mix with
            a wooden spoon or fork until the mixtures are just-blended. Scoop the batter onto a hot,
            oiled griddle and cook until the pancake is bubbly on the top. Flip with a spatula
            and cook until both sides are brown. </li>
    </ol>
